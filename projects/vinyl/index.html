        <h1>What is Vinyl?</h1>
        <p>
          Vinyl is a framework which allow you to write articles,
          poster, slides, etc. with up-to-date, wide spreaded and
          widely used technologies : HTML, CSS, JS.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you work in research (and even if not), you probably
          know <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>.
          It's a powerful document preparation system mainly used
          to create PDF document for scientific article or poster.
          But LaTeX has many drawbacks: weird Unicode support,
          weird fonts support, complicated compilation chain, hard
          styling features, old style output, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vinly aims to fix these keeping the better aspects
          (plain text input file, separated content/style) and
          features (auto-numbering of figures, table, parts;
          automatic bibliography with styles, etc.) of LaTeX.

        <h1>How can I use it?</h1>
        <p>
          As said earlier, Vinyl is based on HTML, CSS and JS.
          However, for development, we use SCSS instead of CSS and
          CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript. Finally, HTML is
          managed with the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
          engine. So Vinyl can be used in two ways: from source code
          or from generated files.
        </p>

        <h2>Source code</h2>
        <p>
          This method is probably the best if you need to customize
          the style or behaviour of Vinyl. Just update the files
          according the <a href="#">development documentation</a>
          (soon) to fit your needs. Then, let's Jekyll render your
          document.
        </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
              <strong>Tip: </strong>Jekyll is quite hard to install
              for those who don't know very well NodeJS, npm &amp; co.
              My advice is to use <a href="http://docker.io/">docker
              </a> instead. The
              <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll/">
                jekyll
              </a> container is very easy to use!
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Generated files (soon)</h2>
        <p>
          If you prefer classic CSS/JS, you can download the
          <a href="#">generated files</a> archive (soon). It contains all the file
          generated from SCSS/CoffeeScript and you can still modify
          these classical files (it's just a little bit more tricky
          because there is less comments, logic, etc.)

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <h2>Styling</h2>
        <p>
          The first part of Vinyl is it's styling one. This is
          achieved thanks to a well structured HTML document and a
          CSS file. Nothing really fancy here, except two things to
          notice.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, CSS allow to handle page breaks when you print
          your document. This allow for example to add a page break
          after the front pages and before the annexes, but also to
          avoid a title to appear alone at the bottom of a page.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, auto-numbering can be achieved with CSS. For the
          moment, we use this feature for title numbering in
          articles. Maybe we will use it also to number tables,
          figures, algorithms, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
          The main feature that we want to re-implement from LaTeX
          is the bibliography management. This is achieved with
          JavaScript, loading the bibliography file (only bibTex for
          the moment), and rendering the bibliography entries (only
          plain style for the moment). We tried to setup a modular
          system to easily add support for different bibliography
          file format (bibJson intended) and bibliography style
          (apalike next and more to come). Feel free to add more
          (see the <a href="#">development documentation</a>
          (soon)).
